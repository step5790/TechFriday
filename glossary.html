          <h3>Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            Resolution is a measure used to describe the sharpness and clarity
            of an image or picture. It is often used as a metric for judging the
            quality of monitors, printers, digital images and various other
            hardware and software technologies.

          <h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>
          <p>
            Aspect ratio describes the ratio between the width and height of an
            image or screen. A 1:1 aspect ratio, for example, is a square.The
            first number always refers to the width, and the second number
            refers to the height. If the ratio of an image is different than the
            ratio of your screen, you may not see the whole image. Images wonâ€™t
            fit properly if the screen is narrower than the image.
