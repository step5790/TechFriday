          <h3>Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            Resolution is a measure used to describe the sharpness and clarity
            of an image or picture. It is often used as a metric for judging the
            quality of monitors, printers, digital images and various other
            hardware and software technologies.

          <h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>
          <p>
            Aspect ratio describes the ratio between the width and height of an
            image or screen. A 1:1 aspect ratio, for example, is a square.The
            first number always refers to the width, and the second number
            refers to the height. If the ratio of an image is different than the
            ratio of your screen, you may not see the whole image. Images wonâ€™t
            fit properly if the screen is narrower than the image.

          <h3>Refresh Rate</h3>
          <p>
            The refresh rate measures how quickly the display updates. In other
            words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes.
            Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times
            the display refreshes every second it is on. A 60Hz display
            refreshes 60 times per second, 90Hz is 90 times per second, and
            120Hz is 120 times per second.

          <h3>Screen Size</h3>
          <p>
            The numbers above represent the viewport size of your current
            screen, which is the visible display area of your screen. This is
            often slightly smaller than your screen resolution. A web design
            viewport is defined as a rectangular area (measured in pixels) that
            is displayed on the screen and determines how the content is
            arranged and where to scroll through the text wrappers or windows to
            see the entire web page.

          <h3>Display Technology</h3>
          <p>
            A display is a computer output surface and projecting mechanism that
            shows text and often graphic images to the computer user, using a
            cathode ray tube ( CRT ), liquid crystal display ( LCD ),
            light-emitting diode, gas plasma, or other image projection
            technology
